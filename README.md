<<<<<<< HEAD

A Logging Package for Luvit.

![N34T Preview](https://image.ibb.co/hN7Pmp/n34t_colors.png)

## Installation

```bash
lit install mrtnpwn/N34T
```

## Usage

N34T has some NEAT functions for logging, these are:

* ``N34T.info(message)``
* ``N34T.warn(message)``
* ``N34T.success(message)``
* ``N34T.error(message)``

and ``N34T.output``, this one is the name of the output file (if you want to have one).

## Example

```lua
local l = require('N34T')
l.output = 'my-output.log'

l.info('Info Message, Yay!')
--> will make a file called 'my-output.log' with the info message.
```
